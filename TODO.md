# Things to try/do with my dotfiles

- Switch from vim-plug to packer (https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
- Investigate nvim-tree (https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua)
- Move from lightline to a different status line - keeping buffer line functionality
- Switch up colorscheme - https://www.opensourceagenda.com/projects/kanagawanvim
- maybe indent guide? - https://github.com/lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim
- figure out a good mapping for jumping to replacements in snippets - ctrl+m doesn't work? (iTerm?)
